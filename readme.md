# Tensorflow input pipeline: large datasets and data augmentation

The new high level Dataset API makes it quite easy to deal with large datasets. No need to bother with queues anymore.

This notebook gives a short example of how to use the Dataset API for:
* loading multiple files for each input example,
* data augmentation.

## Usage

Please look at the notebook here:
